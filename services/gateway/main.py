API Gateway - Single entry point for all platform traffic.

The gateway serves two purposes (as described in Chapter 2):
1. External HTTP traffic → Routes to workflow containers based on API paths
2. Internal gRPC traffic → Routes to platform services based on x-target-service metadata

This is a single gateway component that handles both types of traffic.
Internally, it runs two servers (HTTP and gRPC) but presents a unified gateway interface.
